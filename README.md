# Psychic-Game

<p> Hello, here is a link to my Psychic game: https://annapark23.github.io/Psychic-Game/. </p>

<p> In this project, I was able to create a code where the the computer generates a random letter for the user to guess. The program is able to keep track of the score and resets when the user/computer wins. </p>
